# Website Performance Analysis
# Overview
This project demonstrates how to analyze website performance metrics using Python, focusing on user engagement and traffic patterns. By examining key indicators such as sessions, user engagement time, and events per session, we can gain insights into how users interact with a website and identify areas for improvement.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis includes the following columns:
1. **Session Primary Channel Group:** The marketing channel through which users accessed the website (e.g., Direct, Organic Social).
2. **Date + Hour (YYYYMMDDHH):** The specific date and hour of the session.
3. **Users:** Number of users in a given period.
4. **Sessions:** Number of sessions in that period.
5. **Engaged Sessions:** Number of sessions with significant user engagement.
6. **Average Engagement Time per Session:** The average time a user is engaged per session.
7. **Engaged Sessions per User**: Ratio of engaged sessions to total sessions per user.
8 **Events per Session:** Average number of events (actions taken) per session.
9. **Engagement Rate**: The proportion of sessions that were engaged.
10. **Event Count:** Total number of events during the period.

# Features
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and correcting data inconsistencies.
2. **Session Analysis:** Understanding traffic trends over time.
3. **User Engagement Analysis:** Evaluating metrics like average engagement time, engagement rate, and events per session.
4. **Channel Performance Analysis:** Assessing the effectiveness of different marketing channels.
5. **Traffic Forecasting:** Predicting future website traffic using time series forecasting methods.

# Technologies Used
1. **Python:** Core programming language for analysis.
2. **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
3. **Matplotlib & Plotly:** Data visualization.
4. **Statsmodels:** Time series analysis and forecasting.
